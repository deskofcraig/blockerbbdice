BLOCKING RULES & PROCEDURES

Blocking
At its most basic, a block is a very rough tackle. The rules of Blood Bowl allow players to do almost anything to bring down an opponent, and provided weapons aren't used, the officials rarely make any distinction between a skilled tackle and a frenzied rain of pummelling blows that leave a player unconscious. This is part of the game's charm. After all, who wouldn't want to watch a violent, full contact bloodsport that happens to include some ball related drama!

BLOCK ACTIONS
When a Standing player is activated, they can immediately nominate a single Standing opposition player that they are currently Marking and declare that they will target them with a Block action. Unlike other actions, there is no limit to how many players may perform a Block action each team turn.

A player performing a Block action cannot move before or after, and Prone players cannot stand up and perform a Block action. However, if the target of the Block action is 'pushed back' into another square, the player that made the action may 'follow-up' into the square vacated, carried forward by the momentum of the attack.

Once per team turn, a single player on the active team may perform a Blitz action. A Blitz action combines a Block action with a Move action. A Blitz action may be performed by a Prone player.

Block actions are resolved using special block dice, unique to Blood Bowl. How many block dice are rolled and which coach chooses the result to apply is determined by the Strength of the player performing the Block action compared with the Strength of the player that is the target of the Block action.

STRENGTH
Once an active player has declared they will perform a Block action and nominated their target, the next thing to do is to compare the Strength characteristic of both players, including any Strength modifiers granted by Skills or Traits or offered by 'assists' from teammates (see opposite). If one player is stronger than the other, they are more likely to knock their opponent down:

If both players have the same Strength characteristic, after modification, one block dice is rolled.
If one player has a higher Strength characteristic, after modification, a pool of two block dice is rolled and the coach of the stronger player selects which result to apply.
If one player has a Strength characteristic that is more than double that of their opponent, after modification, a pool of three block dice is rolled and the coach of the stronger player selects which result to apply.
ASSISTING A BLOCK
The Strength characteristic of the player that is performing the Block action, or of the player that is the target of the Block action, can be modified by assists offered by teammates that are in a position to help. In this way, two or more players can gang up on another. There are two types of assist that can be counted: 'offensive' and 'defensive'.

OFFENSIVE ASSISTS
An offensive assist is when another player on the active team, a teammate of the player that is performing the Block action, is able to assist. To offer an offensive assist, a player must be Marking the opposition player that is the target of their teammate's Block action.

A player cannot offer an offensive assist if they are being Marked by any opposition player other than the one that is the target of their teammate's Block action.

Each offensive assist counted modifies the Strength characteristic of the player performing the Block action by +1.

DEFENSIVE ASSISTS
A defensive assist is when another player on the inactive team, a teammate of the player that is the target of a Block action, is able to assist. To offer a defensive assist, a player must be Marking the opposition player that is performing the Block action against their teammate.

A player cannot offer a defensive assist if they are being Marked by any opposition player other than the one that is performing the Block action against their teammate.

Each defensive assist counted modifies the Strength characteristic of the player that is the target of the Block action by +1.

BLOCK DICE
Once offensive and defensive assists have been worked out and the number of block dice to be rolled determined, roll the block dice. Block dice feature five icons, each representing an outcome. Some of these outcomes can be modified by Skills or Traits possessed by one or both players:

PLAYER DOWN!
Something has gone terribly wrong and the player performing the Block action has come off the worst. The active player is immediately Knocked Down by the player they were attempting to block!

BOTH DOWN
Neither player comes off particularly well. Both the active player and the target of the Block action are Knocked Down by one another.

If one of the players has the Block skill (as described on page 76), they may choose to ignore this result and not be Knocked Down. If both players have the Block skill, they may both ignore this result, in which case both players bash heads in a clatter of armour, but nothing else really happens!

PUSH BACK
The active player gives their opponent an almighty shove, forcing them backwards. The target of the Block action is pushed back one square by the active player. The active player may follow-up into the square vacated. Pushing other players is covered in more detail on page 58.

STUMBLE
The target of the Block action attempts to avoid their aggressor. If the target of the Block action has the Dodge skill and chooses to use it (as described on page 75), they are able to avoid being hit and this result becomes a Push Back, as described above. Otherwise, this result becomes a POW!, as described below. In either case, the active player may follow-up into the square vacated.

POW!
The block is tremendously effective and the target keels over to land flat on their back! The target of the Block action is pushed back by the active player and is then Knocked Down in the square they have been moved into. The active player may follow up into the square vacated.

SELECT AND APPLY RESULT
Regardless of the Strength of the players involved, it is always the coach of the player performing the Block action that will roll the block dice. If a pool of two or more block dice is being rolled, it is always the coach of the player with the higher Strength that will select which result is applied against the target.

Note that when both players have the same Strength characteristic, only one block dice is rolled, so there is only one result available!

--------------------------------------------------

FOULING RULES & PROCEDURES

Kicking Them While They're Down
Fouling is strictly against the rules of Blood Bowl, and any player tempted to stick the boot in risks the wrath of the referees. Not that this stops anyone of course! Many teams are renowned for being dirty and devious, and more than a few players have built a career upon the art of the foul. Indeed, fouling is now such an established part of the game that the RARG has established guidelines allowing members to turn a blind eye.

FOUL ACTIONS
As mentioned previously, once per team turn, a single player on the active team may commit a Foul action. When activated, the player nominates a single Prone or Stunned player on the opposing team to be the victim of the Foul. The player may move before committing the Foul, following all of the normal movement rules, but must be in a square adjacent to the player they wish to Foul when the action is made. Once the Foul has been committed, they may not move further and their activation comes to an end.

FOULING
To commit a Foul, simply make an Armour roll (and possible Injury roll) against the nominated victim. Offensive and defensive assists are worked out before this Armour roll is made, exactly as when performing a Block action, as described on page 57. Rather than modifying Strength, these assists will modify the Armour roll:

Apply a +1 modifier to the Armour roll for each offensive assist.
Apply a -1 modifier to the Armour roll for each defensive assist.
BEING SENT-OFF
Regardless of the outcome, if a natural double is rolled (i.e., if two 2s are rolled before applying any modifiers) when making either the Armour roll or an Injury roll against the victim of the Foul action, the referee has seen a player committing a foul right in front of them and that cannot be ignored. The player committing the Foul action is Sent-off. They are immediately removed from play and must miss the rest of the game. When a player is Sent-off, a Turnover is caused.

ARGUING THE CALL
When a player is Sent-off by the referee for committing a Foul, their coach may attempt to Argue the Call. Roll a D6 and refer to the table below:

ARGUE THE CALL
D6	RESULT
1	"You're Outta Here!" The referee is so enraged that the coach is ejected along with the player. For the remainder of this game, you may no longer Argue the Call and must apply a -1 modifier when rolling for Brilliant Coaching.
2‑5	"I Don't Care!" The referee is not interested in your argument. The player is Sent-off and a Turnover caused.
6	"Well, When You Put It Like That.." The referee is swayed by your argument. A Turnover is still caused, but the player that committed the Foul is not Sent-off.

--------------------------------------------------

KNOCKED INTO CROWD RULES & PROCEDURES

INJURY BY THE CROWD
When a player is pushed back into the crowd or lands in the crowd there is no telling how the fans will treat them, and they risk Injury by the Crowd. No Armour roll is made against the player. Instead the coach of the opposing team immediately rolls on the Injury table to see what the crowd does to the player:

If the player is Stunned, they are placed in the Reserves box.
If the player is Knocked-out, they are placed in the Knocked-out box. They may recover as usual at the end of the drive.
If the player becomes a casualty, they are placed in the Casualty box. A roll is made against them on the Casualty table, as described below.
CASUALTY ROLLS

--------------------------------------------------

ARMOUR & INJURY RULES & PROCEDURES

Armour And Injuries
There are many ways in which a Blood Bowl player can get injured. From being gored by a rampaging Minotaur, to tripping and breaking an ankle whilst Rushing, Blood Bowl is a game that provides almost limitless opportunity to get seriously hurt! Even death is an ever-present threat! Most Blood Bowl players proudly sport impressive scars, and it is widely said that an old pro can be easily identified by the way they wince and grumble about their aches and pains during wet weather.

RISKING INJURY
As described on page 27, whenever one player is Knocked Down by another, be it as the result of a Block action or some other, more devious trick, they become Prone and risk injury. Likewise, whenever a player Falls Over, most often caused by failing an Agility test when dodging, or tripping as they Rush across the pitch, they become Prone and risk injury. When a player is Knocked Down or Falls Over, the coach of the opposing team will make an Armour roll against that player.

Note that when a player is Placed Prone, perhaps having wrestled an opponent to the ground, there is no risk of injury and no Armour roll is made against them.

ARMOUR ROLLS
An Armour roll is made as described on page 29, by the coach of the opposing team. If the player's armour is 'broken', an Injury roll is made. If their armour is not broken, it protects them from harm.

INJURY ROLLS
Whenever a player's armour is broken, an Injury roll is made against them. The coach of the opposing team rolls 2D6 and consults the table below:

INJURY TABLE
2D6	RESULT
2‑7	Stunned: The player immediately becomes Stunned, as described on page 27, and is laid face-down on the pitch.
8‑9	KO'd: The player is immediately removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of their team dugout. At the end of each drive, there is a chance any Knocked-out players will recover, as described on page 66.
10+	Casualty! The player becomes a casualty and is immediately removed from play and placed in the Casualty box of their team dugout. The coach of the opposing team rolls on the Casualty table to determine exactly what has happened to the player (as follows).
STUNTY PLAYERS
Players with the Stunty trait (see page 86) are particularly small and fragile, meaning they are more prone to breaking when hit! If an Injury roll is ever made against a player with the Stunty trait, roll on this table instead:

STUNTY INJURY TABLE
2D6	RESULT
2‑6	Stunned: The player immediately becomes Stunned, as described on page 27, and is laid face-down on the pitch.
7‑8	KO'd: The player is immediately removed from play and placed in the Knocked-out box of their team dugout. At the end of each drive, there is a chance any Knocked-out players will recover, as described on page 66.
9	Badly Hurt: The player becomes a casualty and is immediately removed from play and placed in the Casualty box of their team dugout. No Casualty roll is made. Instead, a Badly Hurt result is automatically applied against them.
10+	Casualty!: The player becomes a casualty and is immediately removed from play and placed in the Casualty box of their team dugout. The coach of the opposing team immediately makes a Casualty roll against the player, as described opposite.


--------------------------------------------------

CASUALTY RULES & PROCEDURES

CASUALTY ROLLS
Whenever a player becomes a casualty, a Casualty roll is made against them. The coach of the opposing team rolls a D16 and consults the table below:

CASUALTY TABLE
D16	RESULT	EFFECT
1‑6	Badly Hurt	The player misses the rest of this game, but suffers no long term effect
7‑9	Seriously Hurt	MNG
10‑12	Serious Injury	NI and MNG
13‑14	Lasting Injury	Characteristic Reduction and MNG
15‑16	DEAD	This player is far too dead to play Blood Bowl!
MNG (MISS NEXT GAME)
The player misses the rest of this game, but will need more time to recuperate. In league play, the player is not available to play in the team's next game. Make a note of this on the Team Draft list. The team's CTV is reduced by this player's current value until the end of the post-game sequence of the team's next game (see page 69). If this player's absence leaves the team with fewer than 11 players, they are replaced by a Journeyman player ahead of the next game, as described on page 38.

NI (NIGGLING INJURY)
Make a note on the Team Draft list that this player has picked up a Niggling Injury. There is a +1 modifier applied to all future rolls made against this player on the Casualty table per Niggling Injury they have.

CHARACTERISTIC REDUCTION
The player has one of their characteristics reduced by 1. To determine which, roll a D6 on the table below.

In the case of Movement Allowance or Strength, the characteristic is simply reduced by 1. In the case of Agility, Passing Ability or Armour Value, the target number is raised by 1. For example, if a player with AG4+ suffers a Neck Injury, the characteristic would become AG5+.

In the case of Movement Allowance or Strength, the characteristic is simply reduced by 1. In the case of Agility or Passing Ability, the target number is raised by 1. For example, if a player with AG4+ suffers a Neck Injury, the characteristic would become AG5+. In the case of Armour Value, the target number is lowered by 1. For example, if a player with AV9+ suffers a Head Injury, the characteristic would become AV8+.

Note, however, that no characteristic can ever be reduced below the minimum value shown on page 28.

LASTING INJURY TABLE
D6	LASTING INJURY	CHARACTERISTIC REDUCTION
1‑2	HEAD INJURY	-1 AV
3	SMASHED KNEE	-1 MA
4	BROKEN ARM	-1 PA
5	NECK INJURY	-1 AG
6	DISLOCATED SHOULDER	-1 ST
DEAD
This player is dead! Dead players are dismissed from the team during Step 1 of the post-game sequence, as described on page 69.

--------------------------------------------------

APOTHECARY RULES & PROCEDURES

APOTHECARIES
Once per game, a team with an apothecary may use them to 'patch-up' any permanently hired players belonging to it that have been removed from play after being Knocked-out or after having a Casualty roll made against them. An apothecary cannot be used to patch-up any Journeymen players or any Induced players, such as Mercenaries or Star Players. Journeymen are rarely considered worth the effort, whilst Mercenaries and Star Players travel with their own staff of healers and medics.

PATCHING-UP KNOCKED-OUT PLAYERS
Once per game, an apothecary can be used immediately when a player becomes Knocked-out:

If the player was on the pitch when they were Knocked-out, they are not removed from play. Instead, they remain on the pitch and become Stunned.
If the player was Knocked-out as a result of being pushed back into the crowd or landing in the crowd, place them directly into the Reserves box rather than the Knocked-out box.
PATCHING-UP CASUALTIES
Alternatively, once per game an apothecary can be used when a Casualty roll is made against a player:

Immediately after the Casualty roll is made against your player, you may declare the use of an apothecary.
The coach of the opposing team rolls again on the Casualty table, giving two possible outcomes. You may choose which result is applied to your player.
If a Badly Hurt result is applied, the apothecary has been able to patch the player up and pump them full of painkillers. The player is removed from the Casualty box and placed in the Reserves box.
Note that the use of an apothecary comes before any other attempts to heal the player. This includes the use of any Skills or Traits, or any other in-game effect or special rule that may modify the Casualty roll or its effect.
